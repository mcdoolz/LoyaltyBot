####Future Features/Extras
- Free subscriber/paid non-subscriber Jukebox (still in development)

```javascript
var loyaltybot = require('./../lib/initialize.js');

loyaltybot.initialize({
    // twitch info
    twitch : {
        channel     : 'loyalty',
        bot         : {name: 'LoyaltyBot', password: 'loyalty!loyalty!loyalty!'},
        subscribers : 'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/****/od6/public/basic?alt=json'
    },

        user     : 'mysql_user',
        password : 'mysql_password',
        database : 'mysql_database',
        website  : '' // <--- CAN BE AN EMPTY STRING
    },

    // optional features
    commands: true
});
```

Twitch
- `channel`: the channel name (in lower case)
- `bot.name`: the account name of the bot
- `bot.password`: the password for the bot
- `subscribers`: a google doc that contains subscriber names (more info on this later)

Currency
- `name`: custom name for the loyalty points
- `payrate`: how often to hand out loyalty points (in minutes)
- `host`: mysql database hostname/ip
- `user`: username for the mysql database
- `password`: password for the mysql database
- `database`: mysql database name
- `website`: provides loyalty bot with an offsite location for checking currency. can also be and be an empty `string`

Optional
- `commands`: enable/disable the ability to use moderator commands. boolean: accepts `true` or `false`

## Preparing to Setup Your Channel's Bot
####Create a new bot account

In order to use LoyaltyBot's features you will need to create a new [TwitchTV Account](http://www.twitch.tv/signup). You can name it anything you wish, all you need to do is pass the username/password to `bot.name` and `bot.password`

####Create the subscriber/loyal viewer list on Google Docs

Since TwitchTV does not have subscriber information in their api, LoyaltyBot needs a way to obtain that information. That's where [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) comes in.

In the following order:
- Create a new spreadsheet
- Set cell A1 as the header "Username"
- Subscriber names (must be lower case) will then be in column A starting in cell A2 and below (Fig. 1)
- Set the subscriber list to public and change the type to json (Fig. 2)

Side Notes:
- Even if you do not have a subscription button, you can still add loyal viewers to this list for the double loyalty point benefits.
- Why Google Docs and not the MySQL database? Simplicity. It's easier to manually update a google doc spreadsheet daily
- then it is to update a MySQL table.

####Setting up MySQL tables

LoyaltyBot stores all of the viewer info and moderator commands in a MySQL database and requires specifc table/field names.

LoyaltyBot takes care of all table creation, however if by some chance you need to manually setup the tables the following contains information about them:

Viewer
- Table Name: `viewers`
- Field Names: `user` [primary key, not null, varchar], `points` [not null, integer]

Commands
- Table Name: `commands`
- Field Names: `id` [primary key, autoincrement, not null, integer], `command` [not null, text], `text` [not null, longtext], `auth` [default: 1, integer]
